This crate provides access to the keyboard lights of MSI notebooks with Steel
Series gaming keyboards. It is cross platform and compatible with windows and
linux. The goal of this project is the creation of a GUI and a command line
application. These should be able to replace the Steel Series Engine 3 on
windows, and also provide control over keyboard lights for linux users.

This crate is a work in progress, because there are missing features in the API.
The API is feature complete, when the functionality is comparable to the Steel
Series Engine 3.
